        ACCELA was not born from inspiration — it was born from necessity. There wasn't a tool aligned with the structure that was needed. So the webmaster stopped waiting. And started building.
        <br><br>
        <strong>🚀 Currently: Core topics are <span style="color: #00ffcc;">free to access</span>.</strong><br>
        <strong>🔒 Full access will become premium soon.</strong><br>
        <em>You're early — use it while it's free.</em><br>
        <br>
        ⏳ <u>Free trial ends on <strong>10 August 2025</strong>.</u> After that, access will be locked unless upgraded.
        <br><br>
        This is not a traditional study site. It's a system shaped around <em>Active Recall</em>. You won't remember what you just read. You'll remember what your memory was forced to retrieve. That's the rule — we remember what we remembered, not what we read.
        <br><br>
        There's a Cbox. It's more than a chat — it's a bridge. Questions, suggestion, appreciation — everything is signal. And all signal reaches the webmaster.
        <br><br>
        You've entered a space shaped by need, refined by memory, and held together by obsession.  
        <br><br>
        Thank you for entering. If you have something to say, leave a trace in the Cbox.
